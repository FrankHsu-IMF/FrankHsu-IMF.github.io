*Created by Po Yao Hsu on 20250312*

## Map 🗺️
I basically have been in Hssinchu for my entire life. I was born in Hsinchu, finihsed senior highschool and highschool in Hsinchu, and still got myself into NYCU. I don't have strong crave for moving out.

## Food 🍟🍖🍣
I love all I can eat, but I do prefer food to eat with others, like hotpot.
As for treats, I sometime make breads at home.
